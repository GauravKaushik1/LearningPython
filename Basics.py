# format string in python
# Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d".

# Let's say you have a variable called "name" with your user name in it, and you would then like to print(out a greeting to that user.)

# This prints out "Hello, John!"
# name = "Gaurav"
# print("Hello, %s!" % name)
# Run
# To use two or more argument specifiers, use a tuple (parentheses):
# This prints out "John is 23 years old."
# name = "Gaurav"
# age = 23
# print("%s is %d years old." % (name, age))

# Run
# Any object which is not a string can be formatted using the %s operator as well. The string which returns from the "repr" method of that object is formatted as the string. For example:
# This prints out: A list: [1, 2, 3]
# mylist = [1,2,3]
# print("A list: %s" % mylist)

# Run
# Here are some basic argument specifiers you should know:
# data = ("Gaurav", "Kaushik", 53.44)
# format_string = "Hello "

# Using f-string for formatting
# print(f"{format_string}{data}")

# data = ("Gaurav", "Kaushik", 53.44)
# format_string = "Hello {}"

# Using format() method for formatting
# print(format_string.format(data))

# %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)

# %d - Integers

# %f - Floating point numbers

# %.<number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot.

Types of Operators
Arithmetic Operators(+, -, *, /, %, **)
Relational / Comparision Operators(==, !=, >, <, >=, <= )
Assignment Operators(=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=)
Logical Operators(not, and, or)
Membership Operators(in, in not)
Identity Operators(is, is not)
Bitwise Operators(&, |, ^)

Operator precedence
The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

Operator	Description	Try it
()	Parentheses	
**	Exponentiation	
+x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
*  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
+  -	Addition and subtraction	
<<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts	
&	Bitwise AND	
^	Bitwise XOR	
|	Bitwise OR	
==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
not	Logical NOT	
and	AND	
or	OR	
If two operators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right.

File I/O in Python
Python can be used to perform operations on a file. (read & write data)
Types of all files
1. Text Files : .txt, .docx, .log, etc.
2. Binary Files : .mp4, .mov, .png, .jpeg, etc.
RAM - is fast in execution and Code run variables are created in RAM. RAM is a volatile memory once system is shutdown the data of RAM is lost and not stored permanently into RAM. Files form storage saving in to system's scondary storage in files form.

Open, read & close File
We have to open a file before reading or writing.

file_name -> sample.txt, demo.docx
mode -> r: read mode, w: write mode, x:create a new file and open it for writing, a: open for writing/appending to the end of the file if it exists, b: binary mode, t: text mode (default), +: open a disk file for updating (reading and writing). Default is read.
Also a and w modes can be used to create the file
